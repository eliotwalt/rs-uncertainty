# Uncertainty and Robustness in Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring

This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis written at the Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Group at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Most of the code is taken from [this repository](https://github.com/prs-eth/bayes-forest-structure), to which we added evaluation and plotting utilities. 

Note that the data folders are not included. The drive containing this was mounted at the root of the repository in a folder called `assets/`. Results and additional data can be found on Euler. 

## Code organization

* `./config` configuration files for different tasks
* `./gee` all things Google Earth Engine and Google Drive
  * `download_timeseries.py` is the main script used to download non-aggregated timeseries of Sentinel-2 images associated to a given ALS project
  * `gee_download.py` and `gdrive_handler.py` take care of downloading GEE images to a Google drive and locally automatically
  * This code requires to get `credentials.json` and `token.json` from the [Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/apis/) after creating a GEE project and authorizing the use of Google drive API on your own account 

* `./notebooks` notebooks containing the plots of the main analysis
* `./run` bash scripts designed to launch specific jobs on Euler
  * Note that the concept of "one image dataset" is used throughout the code for compatibility with the original code organization. It consists in creating a dataset from a single image by changing a flat file structure into a nested file structure. see `src` for more details
* `./src` contains the core of the python code
  * `./src/scripts` contains the code for the main tasks (training, evaluating, etc.)
    * `configure_one_image_dataset_experiment.py` can be used to generate "one image datasets" configuration files from a triplet of create/predict/eval template config files (see `./config/{create_dataset,evaluate_dataset,predict_testset}/*_template.yaml`) using symbolic links to temporary directories.
  * `viz.py` contains the code for all multi-level plots shown in the analysis
  * `metrics.py` contains the online computation implementation of the RCU metrics
